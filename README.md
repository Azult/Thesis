# Thesis
Code for my MEMS analysis

_FAPMP.py_ - Find the Amplitude & the Phase by the Maximal Pixel
 - Calculates the membrane amlitudes by using 37 frames
 
_VertSlider.py_ - There is no vertical slider in Tkinter, so I found one on github
 - Needed for FAPMP.py
 
_FCA.py_ - The name doesnt mean somthing relevent
 - Converts a .py file to extractable (compiled) .pyc file
  
_fileToPic.py_
 - Converts a file you type in to a .png file
 
_pics2GIF.py_
 - Creates a GIF file out of all my 37 frames
 
_txt2pic.py_
 - Converts all the phase files into phase##.png
 
_txt2pic2.py_
 - Converts all the Amplitude.txt file into a png file names Amplitude + the local filder
   to indicate the spesific mesurment

_disableIO.py_
 - Disables the keyboard and mouse of the pc.
   Not that usefull and also makes you have to restart your pc :)
